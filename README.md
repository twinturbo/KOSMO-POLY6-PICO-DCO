# KOSMO-POLY6-PICO-DCO

**DRAFT**
This repository contains source code, schematics and PCBs for a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) with up to 6 voices which are driven by a Raspberry Pi Pico. It uses PIO to generate a highly accurate frequency which is controlled by USB or serial MIDI. The analog oscillator part is based on the Juno 106 and generates sawtooth and square wave signal with a 10Vpp amplitude. Amplitude compensation is done by a smoothed PWM signal coming from the Pico.

This version is a re-design of PolyKit's Pico DCO to fit into the "Look Mum No Computer" "Kosmo Format".

## Key features

- Frequency modulation (FM)  ------ [ requires sub control board ] See > Not Done
- Separate gate signal 
- DIN MIDI serial input
- USB MIDI input
- MIDI pitch bend
- Portamento with adjustable speed

Gerber files for the PCB can be found [here](HARDWARE\PCB-PRINTS).
 There are four files to pprint. 
 
## Installation on the paspbery Pi Pico (simple)
**DRAFT**

Press `BOOTSEL` button on the Pico while powering it with USB. Copy file `build/pico-dco.uf2` onto the USB mass storage device.

## Usage
**DRAFT**

After installing the Pico should register as USB MIDI device. Alternatively serial MIDI input is available. The DCO listens to note on/note off messages on MIDI channel 1. Pitch bend is also supported. Portamento can be enabled by MIDI CC message #65, portamento time can be adjusted by CC message #5.

## Quirks

Initialy the voices will be floating on startup which if directly outputed ( not through an ADSR/VCA ) may present as noise, as each of the voices is initialised by a key press the noise will go away. 

## Detuning, stacking and FM
**DRAFT**
The built-in analog-to-digital converter can be used to modulate these parameters. You can add an external control voltage (0-3.3V) to that input pins. These features can be disabled by commenting (`//`) the following lines:

```
#define USE_ADC_STACK_VOICES // gpio 28 (adc 2)
#define USE_ADC_DETUNE       // gpio 27 (adc 1)
#define USE_ADC_FM           // gpio 26 (adc 0)
```
